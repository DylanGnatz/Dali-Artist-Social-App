## Pain points

Many artists struggle to network or build relationships with others in the community, especially when they are new to their medium, didn’t attend art school, or are natural introverts. Additionally, many artists live semi-nomadic lives, and it’s difficult to establish roots and personal connections when they’re constantly moving around the world. These factors make it difficult for artists to break into their local arts scene, especially when they lack direct connections with other artists in their space. Being part of a community of artists is incredibly inspiring and motivating, but oftentimes it’s difficult to find others with the same interests and influences.
Sales, commissions, and client interactions are often group efforts and facilitated by other artists, so knowing the right people is critical to succeeding in the field. When artists don’t have that network around them, promoting themselves and their craft is an uphill battle. The pain point we are aiming to solve with our product is the fact that building a network, especially among creatives, is a slow face-to-face process that we hope to optimize using technology.

## What we do

Our service provides a space to build personal connections and professional networks within the art world. Dali, our SAAS product achieves this goal through a number of features built with the target audience in mind.

Our aim with this product is to create unique user experiences that enables artists to choose what they see on their pages and how others see them. Users build a profile containing information about themselves, their interests, mediums, and a portfolio of their recent works. After finetuning the way they are shown on the app, users have the opportunity to select who and what appears on their swipe and live feed screens giving the option to seek out artists of various mediums or specific events in their area.
When artists match with one another, they can begin chatting. This chat feature replaces the awkward face-to-face interactions that have become the bain of artist networking. Artists can discuss their work, interests, and influences in the hopes of finding like minded individuals who can help them grow their own artistic trajectories.

When a user makes updates to his or her portfolio, these changes are pushed to their local arts feed. Other artists who follow or have matched with the user can see these changes and look at how the user has grown. As users build a following on the app, more and more people are able to view their progress.
These features aim to combine aspects of many different apps: Tinder, Instagram, Pinterest, and Linkedin into one cohesive platform. With all the features required to build a professional and social network in one place, we hope that Dali will enable artists to overcome the oftentime tedious process of building up a network and get back to creating pieces.

## Different from market

Our SaaS solution stands out as different from the market for a number of reasons, the primary being the target audience and our commitment to that audience. At the forefront of our planning and design phase, we have strived to keep our users, artists, in mind. Products specifically geared towards artists are small and sparse and oftentimes have very different scopes. While products and services exist geared towards helping artists create pieces or even learn new aesthetic mediums, Dali stands alone as a service built for artists to meet other artists. Our narrow target audience means that we can specialize our features, products, and even designs towards our market.

By combining features similar to those that exist on LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, and Tinder, we aim to create a new networking tool that sits at the crossroads of professional and social collaboration. With in-house features that offer users a wide range of possible actions, our product is different from other existing services in its aim to become the one and only tool artists really need to branch out into their local environments.

This ties in with our next point - the lack of true market comps. While each one of the previously mentioned apps offers features similar to ours, the combination and target audience is what really separates our service. Dali offers a unique artistic focus and tailored user experience that other apps simply don’t offer.
